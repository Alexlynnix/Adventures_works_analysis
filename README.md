#Adventures_works_analysis
Adventure Works Project:
This project involves analyzing the Adventure Works dataset by performing multiple steps such as importing, cleaning, merging, transforming, and creating fact and dimension tables to develop a comprehensive ER Diagram. The goal is to organize data in a structured format to facilitate analysis and interaction between different tables, helping to generate meaningful insights.

1. Creating and Importing the Tables
The first step is to create and import data into structured tables. These tables represent different aspects of sales activities in the Adventure Works dataset.
